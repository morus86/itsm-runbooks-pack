# Case Study: On-call Incident with Missing Permissions (Anonymized)

## Symptoms
- Alert triggered during on-call
- Team cannot complete remediation due to missing privileged access

## Triage
- Identify the failing action and required permissions
- Confirm scope and urgency
- Check if there is a documented escalation contact

## Mitigation
- Introduce a "Second Support" escalation path (privileged contact / group)
- Document contact method and expected response time
- Validate remediation with the privileged contact

## Follow-up / Prevention
- Review least-privilege vs operational needs
- Create an on-call escalation runbook
- Track recurring cases as Problem records
